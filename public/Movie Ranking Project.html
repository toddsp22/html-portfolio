<h1>The Best Movies According to Todd</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>The Empire Strikes Back</h3>
<p>This is the best fast action move for me. 
    Plus the romance between Han and Liea is moving and funny.</p>

<h3>The Fiddler on the roof.</h3>
<p>This by far my favorite musical. The music is perfect.
    The dialog was moving and funny. Plus the tension between the 
    Jews and the russians worked well. Additionaly you have the best 
    part of all, the scenes where the third daughter marries a 
    Christian Russian. </p>

<h3>The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
<p> This movie came at a particulary hard time for me. The music of 
    Enya lifted me so much, I watched the movie 7 times just to hear 
    the song "May It Be." Plus Tolkien is my favorite author.</p>
